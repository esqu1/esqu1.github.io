<h1>Computer Science</h1>
<p>I majored in computer science in my undergraduate years, so unsurprisingly I'm incredibly passionate about various topics in computation. While there, I did my senior thesis in differential privacy methods in graph statistic computation; which you can find it <a href="./seniorthesis-blin.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2><u>Experience</u></h2>
<p>I currently work at Figma, where we're working on enabling design capabilities for everyone right in the browser. Before that, I worked at Meta (formerly Facebook), where I worked on building an ecosystem of tools for SQL analysis and rich, privacy-aware type-checking, as well as AI infrastructure.

<h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/esqu1">GitHub</a> for some of my projects!
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/esqu1/Rusty-Rubik">Rusty Rubik</a>: a Rubik's Cube representation
        and solver written in Rust. In development: a general-purpose puzzle solver.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/esqu1/torchlint">TorchLint</a>: a device and matrix dimension linter for PyTorch
        programs written in Haskell.</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>College Experiences</u></h2>
<p>
    In my college years, I was a developer and project manager at <a href="http://pennlabs.org">Penn Labs</a> and
    a co-organizer of the <a href="http://pclassic.org/">Philadelphia Classic</a> programming competition.


</p>
<p>
    I've also been a teaching assistant for several of Penn's classes:
