<h1>Computer Science</h1>
<p><b><i>NEW:</i></b> I recently finished my senior thesis in differential privacy methods in graph statistic
    computation. You can find it <a href="./seniorthesis-blin.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I majored in computer science in my undergraduate years, so unsurprisingly I'm incredibly passionate about various
    topics in computation. Broadly, my main interests lie in <b>programming languages, machine learning, and their
        intersection</b>,
    e.g. machine learning compilers, PyTorch, etc. I'm also interested in topics in theoretical
    computer science and differential privacy.</p>
<h2><u>Experience</u></h2>
<p>
    I currently work at Facebook, where I work on building an ecosystem of tools for SQL analysis and rich, privacy-aware type-checking. I've interned at Facebook for two summers (2018 and 2019):
<ul>
    <li>During my first summer, I was on the Dynamic Ads team to help work on the foundations of the dynamic video ads
        template on Facebook.</li>
    <li>During my second summer, I was on the AI Infrastructure Feature Engineering team and developed a system to help
        machine learning teams at Facebook track the relationships and timelines of their features and models.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
<p>Check out my <a href="https://github.com/esqu1">GitHub</a> for some of my projects!
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/esqu1/Rusty-Rubik">Rusty Rubik</a>: a Rubik's Cube representation
        and solver written in Rust. In development: a general-purpose puzzle solver.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/esqu1/torchlint">TorchLint</a>: a device and matrix dimension linter for PyTorch
        programs written in Haskell.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><u>College Experiences</u></h2>
<p>
    In my college years, I was a developer and project manager at <a href="http://pennlabs.org">Penn Labs</a> and
    a co-organizer of the <a href="http://pclassic.org/">Philadelphia Classic</a> programming competition.


</p>
<p>
    I've also been a teaching assistant for several of Penn's classes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://cis522.com">CIS 522</a>: Deep Learning for Data Science</li>
    <li><a href="http://shivani-agarwal.net/Teaching/CIS-520/Spring-2019/index.html">CIS 520</a>: Machine Learning</li>
    <li>CIS 320: Introduction to Algorithms</li>
    <li><a href="http://cis160.com/">CIS 160</a>: Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science</li>
</ul>
